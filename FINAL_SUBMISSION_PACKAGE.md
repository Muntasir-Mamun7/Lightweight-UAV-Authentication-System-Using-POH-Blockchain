## Research Contribution Summary

This paper presents **"A Lightweight and Practical UAV Authentication System Implementation based on Proof-of-History Blockchain"**

### Key Contributions:
1. **Lightweight PoH Engine:** Sequential hashing engine generating tamper-evident UAV telemetry timeline, optimized for standard flight controllers
2. **Production-Ready Implementation:** Achieving >120,000 hashes/second with 12-18ms authentication latency
3. **Full Prototype Validation:** Using Microsoft AirSim and PX4 SITL simulation

### Performance Highlights:
- ⚡ 120,000+ hashes per second throughput
- ⚡ 12-18 ms authentication latency
- ⚡ 6-10 ms telemetry processing
- ⚡ <3 ms block generation
- 🛡️ Resilient against replay attacks
- 🛡️ Tamper-evident data integrity
- ✅ Real-time compatible
- ✅ Resource-efficient for UAVs

### Innovation:
Uses Proof-of-History (sequential hashing) instead of traditional blockchain consensus (PoW), achieving blockchain-level integrity at near-centralized-database performance.
