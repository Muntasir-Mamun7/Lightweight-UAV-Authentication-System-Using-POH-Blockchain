## About

This repository contains the implementation of a lightweight UAV authentication system based on Proof-of-History (PoH) blockchain. The system is designed to provide tamper-evident telemetry logging for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles without the computational overhead of traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms.
