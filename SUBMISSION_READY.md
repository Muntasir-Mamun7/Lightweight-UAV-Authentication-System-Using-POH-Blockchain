## 🔬 Research Highlights

### Main Contributions:
1. **Lightweight PoH Engine** - Sequential hashing for tamper-evident UAV telemetry without distributed consensus overhead
2. **Production-Ready Implementation** - 120,000+ hashes/second with 12-18ms authentication latency

### Performance Metrics:
- ⚡ **120,000+ hashes/second** throughput
- ⚡ **12-18 ms** authentication latency
- ⚡ **6-10 ms** telemetry processing
- ⚡ **<3 ms** block generation latency
- 🛡️ Resilient against replay attacks & data tampering
- ✅ Real-time compatible for UAV operations

### Innovation:
Uses **Proof-of-History** (sequential hashing timeline) instead of traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms, achieving blockchain-level integrity at near-centralized-database performance.
